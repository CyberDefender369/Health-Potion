<h1>Health Potion</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This Python project demonstrates how to implement a health potion system for a character in a video game. It covers fundamental programming concepts, including variable usage, user input handling, basic mathematical calculations, and utilization of the random module. The system offers three difficulty levels (ranging from 1 to 3). Lower difficulty levels grant the character a more substantial health boost, while higher levels provide a more modest increase in health.

<h2>Language and Utilities Used</h2>

- Python 3.10.11
- Thonny 4.1.3
  
<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- Windows 11

<h2>Notes</h2>

This Python program does not validate user input. For example, if the user enters 4 (outside the intended range) the program still produces an output. One solution involves the creation of a function that manages input validation. Another solution would utilize if-else statements and logical operators to ensure input is within a valid range. There are, of course, many more solutions. Input validation will be accounted for in another project.
