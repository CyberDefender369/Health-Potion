<h1>Health Potion</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This simple Python project demonstrates how a health potion would work for a character in a video game. It includes the use of variables, user input, basic mathematical calculations, and the random module. There are three difficulty levels of 1 to 3. A lower difficulty level grants the character more health while a higher difficulty level yields the character less health.

<h2>Language Used</h2>

- Python 3.10.11

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- Windows 11
- Thonny 4.1.3

<h2>Notes</h2>

This Python program does not validate user input. For example, if the user enters 4 (outside the intended range) the program still produces an output. One solution involves the creation of a function that manages input validation. Another solution would utilize if-else statements and logical operators to ensure input is within a valid range. There are, of course, many more solutions. Input validation will be accounted for in another project.
